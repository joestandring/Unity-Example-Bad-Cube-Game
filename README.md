# A pretty bad test about a cube
A project created following the "[How to make a Video Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL)" series by [@Brackeys](https://github.com/Brackeys) in Unity and C#.

This is not a very good game, hence the title. I'm using this to learn some fundamental skills in C# and Unity.

## Currently Implemented "Features"
* Functional main menu with "Play", "Options", and "Exit" buttons.
* Options menu with the ability to toggle fullscreen, change screen resolution, change graphics quality, and change master volume
* A handful of levels 

## Things I Might Get Around to Adding
* Music so that I know my volume slider actually _works_.
* Fix the pause menu I messed up.
* Add the ability to jump/duck.
* Add a High Score table that saves locally (online is scary).
* Add sound effects.
* Make cooler levels to test above features.
